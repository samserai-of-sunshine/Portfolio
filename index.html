			<b>Fun Fact:</b> <br> I have a puppet of myself that I made just because I watched a video and decided I could totally do that. I finished it right on time to show a guest speaker for my major's industry seminar class at UIW who works as a puppeteer at Sesame Street. I don't want to be a puppeteer, I just wanted to  be able to say I can make a puppet. I even made us matching outfits. <br>
